# VBA-challenge
VBA Scripting to analyze generated stock market data

NOTES ABOUT CODE:
	- I used Ask BCS to to help me correctly loop across my worksheets. In the begining of my for loop, the "Output the information to the summary table"
	code was aquired through an explanation by my ask BCS helper.
	- The if statements for checking the greatest percentages values and correctly coloring yearly change were also derived from help form Ask BCS. I was using ws.Cells(i +1, 10) to aquire the values until
	the tutor mentioned it would be preferable to use summaryTableRow, fixing the color scheme
